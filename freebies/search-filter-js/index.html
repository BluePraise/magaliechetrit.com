                <h3>How to make a search and filter with pure JavaScript</h3>
                <small>Posted on: 5 July 2022.</small>
                <h4>What exactly is it? And why is it so special?</h4>
                <p>I was working on a project for a friend and she wanted a search filter on her site. Most active search filters require a database connection or XHR requests. That was a bit too heavy for me. 
                    All I wanted was a functionality that searched through the current page, something light and simple. I couldn't really find anything so I set about making one myself.</p>
                <p>This code snippet is a few lines of codes and you don't need any other libraries or frameworks.</p>
                
                <h4>Show me how it's done!</h4>
                <p>Alright so you're ready to try out my search filter? Great.</p>
                <p class="highlight"><span class="emoji">ü§ù</span>If at any time you have questions, feel free to reach out to me. You can find my contact details below.</p>
                <h4>Here's how it works.</h4>
                <em>I've written this for newbies, so if you're advanced - you may get a little bored.</em>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. The search input.</strong><br>
                    In your html file, you have to paste this:
                    <pre><code>&lt;input type="search" class="js-search-field" placeholder="Type a word.."/&gt;</code></pre>
                    If you're a beginner and do not know any JavaScript, <u>make sure that the classname is the same</u>.
                    In JavaScript it finds <pre>.js-search-field</pre> and has an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">EventListener</a> attached to it. That eventlistener "scans" or "listens" for the users input from the keyboard.
                    
                </p>
                <p>If it turns out that in your project you can't paste that input - you can change the classname to the classname or identifier you may have to use in the JavaScript.</p>
                <p> 
                    <strong>2. The search items.</strong><br>
                    If you're a beginner this is where it may get tricky . If you're using pure HTML and CSS like I am, then it's easy. The JavaScript code finds a classname in the HTML that has all the search entries you want to search through.
                    <pre><code> &lt;li class="search-item"&gt;</ltul></code></pre>
                </p>
