                <h3>How to make a search and filter with pure JavaScript</h3>
                <small>Posted on: 5 July 2022.</small>
                <h4>What exactly is it?</h4>
                <p>I was working on a WordPress portfolio project for a friend and she wanted a search filter on her site. I searched and tried out a few libraries. Although they were very good, they weren't what I was looking for. 
                    Most active search filters require a database connection or XHR requests. That was a bit too heavy for me. 
                    All I wanted was a functionality that searched through a dataset on the current page, something light and simple. 
                </p>
                <p>Time to make something myself. This is a search filter that updates dynamically while the user types. 
                It's very light weight, it doesn't have any bells or whistles. Although you could certainly adapt it with a button or animations.</p>
                <a href="./freebies/search-filter-js/search-filter-demo/">Check out the demo</a>
                <h4>Show me how it's done!</h4>
                <p>Alright so you're ready to try out my search filter? Great.</p>
                <p class="highlight"><span class="emoji">ü§ù</span>If at any time you have questions, feel free to reach out to me. You can find my contact details below.</p>
                <em>I've written this for newbies, so if you're advanced - you may get a little bored.</em>
                <p>
                    <strong>1. The search input.</strong><br>
                    In your html file, you can adapt your code to my example below or just copy and paste it.
                    <small>By the way, <u>make sure that the classname is the same</u>.</small> <span class="emoji">ü´†</span>
                </p>
                <pre class="smaller"><code>&lt;input type="search" class="js-search-field" placeholder="Type a word.."/&gt;</code></pre>
                    <details>
                        <summary><small>More details about this concept</small></summary>
                        <p>The input has a classname .js-search-field (in HTML). Then in JavaScript it has an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener">EventListener</a> attached to it. That eventlistener "scans" or "listens" for the users input from the keyboard. We will be using that information to check if the word can be found.</p>    
                    </details>
                <p>If it turns out that in your project you can't paste that input - you can change the classname to another classname or identifier you may have to use in the JavaScript.</p>
                <p> 
                    <strong>2. The search items.</strong><br>
                    If you're a beginner this is where it may get tricky. But if you're using pure HTML and CSS like I am, then it's less comlicated. If we take a lot at the markup in the <a href="./freebies/search-filter-js/search-filter-demo/">demo</a>, we'll see that the list items we'd like to search through has a classname <small><code>search-item</code></small>. In your HTML file the dataset also needs to have that classname. If you cannot apply the classname, change the name in JavaScript. You will find an example below.
                </p>
                <small>An example.</small>
                <pre class="smaller"><code>const items = [...document.querySelectorAll('.any-name-that-applies')]</code></pre>
                 <details>
                        <summary><small>More details about this concept</small></summary>
                        <p>In JavaScript we assemble an array of all of these search items. The input we've used at 1. (The search input) tries to search by using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter">filter()</a> function with what the user inputs.</p>    
                </details>
                <p>
                    <strong>3. Putting it all together.</strong>
                    When we go back to the script in the <a href="./freebies/search-filter-js/search-filter-demo/">demo</a>, we see another classname referenced: <small><code>search-list</code></small>. This is mainly a container, which holds our data-set. I've chosen to use an unordered list. While the user inputs a search term, this container is emptied and if it finds a match you will see those matches there.
                </p>
                <p>The same advice stands, feel free to use this classname. Otherwise you need to change the classname in the JavaScript. </p>
                <h3>And that's it.</h3>
