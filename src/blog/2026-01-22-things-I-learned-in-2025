### You can pay now or pay double later. Sometimes shortcuts don't pay off.
Last year I worked on a lot of legacy projects. I saw a lot of shortcuts, which caused a lot of trouble down the line. In turn, I learned from that and I try to not make those same mistakes. AI became a heavily used tool for me. Since AI is a tool, one must also learn how to use it to one's advantage. I used it as a shortcut. This is where the pay double later came in. Sometimes AI ( I use Claude ) decided for me and it went in the wrong direction. Turn after turn went wrong. It was so bad that I couldn't even CMD+Z my way out of it. I took some time to start over using my brain and the initial task was resolved faster. I have learned to only let me review and to audit. Maybe even make a suggestion, but I can't let it decide for me. Shortcuts don't pay off.

### I am valuable as a person, not as a coding machine.
With the rise of AI it is very difficult to find a new job. That made me very sad for a while, because it may seem decades of experience may be lost. I really enjoy my work.

### Keep improving my project management skills.
This is strongly related to my previous point. Web Development and any project requires project management skills whether you're a freelance working alone or a junior starting at a big tech company.

In 2023 I simplified Notion and my task management system. Read more about that [here](/blog/2023-06-22-a-few-thoughts-on-projectmanagement/).

### Utilize that Do Not Disturb button
### Make it. Make it pretty later.
### What we perceive as chaos, usually is the beginning of moving onward.

### Learn new things.
This year I learned how to use 11ty. In fact this website is built in 11ty. I also learned about Github Actions. I use to deploy small projects to my staging server.
