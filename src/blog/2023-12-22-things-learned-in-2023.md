## Wrap my functions with conditional checks in JavaScript.
This is a great way to make sure that the function is only called when it's needed. It's also a great way to make sure that the function is only called when the DOM is ready.

## Improve my code with better comments.
Before I started working fully remote at TMSW, I mostly worked alone on my projects so I didn't really felt the need to comment code. But sometimes I lost track of my work and didn't remember exactly what I was doing and why?

The projects at TMSW are much bigger than the projects I've worked on before. Improving my skillset in commenting code became even more important for that reason.

I taught myself how to improve my code by reading the comments in the code of large open source projects. Usually, I adapted the same principles to my own code. It's been working great so far.

Now when I get back to work the next day or after a few days, I can easily pick up where I left off. It's also easier to explain my code to my colleagues when I speak to them about a feature I have been working on.

## Improve my project management skills.
