I would say I am a medior when it comes to JavaScript, SPG and CI/CD. As I am self taught, I am still searching for the best way to do things. Especially, when it comes with folder structure. But as with everything coding, baby steps.

For a while I have wanted to have the date in the footer of my site to be the latest commit date. I couldn't figure out how to do it from the [11ty documentation](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dates/). `git Last Modified` or `git Created` will return "Invalid Datetime".

I searched the web and found a few solutions but they were either too complicated or didn't work for me.
