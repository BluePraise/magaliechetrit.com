ArtEZPress is a WooCommerce Storefront Child Theme that I developed for ArtEZ's publishing house. The theme was designed by Amir Avraham to showcase the client's books, magazines and other publications in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. With a focus on simplicity and elegance, ArtEZ Press aimed to provide an immersive shopping experience for customers.

### The project
Because of budgeting reasons we chose for a WooCommerce Storefront Child Theme. It was a great choice because it allowed us to focus on the design and functionality of the site, rather than spending time on building a custom theme from scratch. The theme was built using WordPress, WooCommerce, and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). The site was also multilingual, with support for English and Dutch. The project was completed in 2017.

### My role in the project
I programmed the theme, set up the WooCommerce store, and integrated the design elements provided by Amir Avraham. I also worked on the site's responsiveness and performance optimization. Another part of the project was advice to the client on business decisions regarding the site. For example, I recommended the use of Polylang for multilingual support, which turned out to be a great choice.

### Technology development
There are two highlights in this project. For the detailed view of a product the designer opted

The first is the custom color picker we built. This feature allows the client to easily change the color scheme of the page without having to edit the CSS. The second highlight is the integration of the WooCommerce store with the site. We used ACF to create custom fields for the products, which allowed us to display the products in a visually appealing way.
