Modem.Work is a boutique architecture studio specializing in innovative and sustainable designs. Their portfolio showcases a diverse range of projects, from residential homes to commercial spaces. One of the studio's architects is a Professor and Head of Architecture at MIT, further emphasizing the studio's commitment to excellence and innovation. As the lead developer, I was responsible for creating a website that highlights Modem.Work's work and reflects the studio's ethos of creativity and sustainability.

The website features a clean and minimalist design by Catalogtree, focusing on the studio's projects. High-quality images and videos offer an immersive experience, allowing visitors to explore each project in detail. The site is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on all devices.

Collaborating with Catalogtree, we chose [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/), a flexible and user-friendly file-based CMS. Despite it being my first time using Kirby CMS, I quickly learned the system and implemented the design efficiently. Kirby CMS enabled us to create a custom backend that the client could easily use to update the site with new projects and content, reducing the need for ongoing support.

A unique feature of the homepage is the "donut" animations, implemented using [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) to create smooth bounce effects. These animations required careful attention to detail to achieve the desired visual impact, adding a dynamic element to the minimalist design.

Through this project, I gained experience with Kirby CMS, including creating custom fields and templates, and developing a custom backend for the client. I used Git for version control and deployed the site using a CI/CD pipeline. The implementation of the donut animations was a challenging but rewarding aspect of the project.
