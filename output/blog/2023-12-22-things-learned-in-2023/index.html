        <h2>Wrap my functions with conditional checks in JavaScript.</h2>
<p>This is a great way to make sure that the function is only called when it's needed and when the DOM is ready.</p>
<h2>Improve my code with better comments.</h2>
<p>Before I started working fully remote at TMSW, I mostly worked alone on my projects so I didn't feel the need to comment code. I did once I lost track of my work and didn't remember exactly what I was doing and why.</p>
<p>The projects at TMSW are much bigger than the projects I've worked on before. Improving my skillset in commenting code became even more important for that reason.</p>
<p>I taught myself how to improve my documentation by reading the comments in the code of large open source projects. Usually, I adapted the same principles to my own code. It's been working great so far.</p>
<p>When I get back to work the next day or after a few days, I can easily pick up where I left off. It's also easier to explain my code to my colleagues when I speak to them about a feature I have been working on.</p>
<p>This also helps me to keep my code clean and tidy. I can easily spot code that is not needed anymore and remove it.</p>
<h2>Keep improving my project management skills.</h2>
<p>This is strongly related to my previous point. Web Development and any project requires project management skills whether you're a freelance working alone or a junior starting at a big tech company.</p>
<p>In 2023 I simplified Notion and my task management system. Read more about that <a href="/blog/2023-06-22-a-few-thoughts-on-projectmanagement/">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Avoid switching tools. Especially for project management.</h2>
<p>I love new tools and I check them out regularly. It's so much fun for me that I even made an anonymous email account to sign up for all the new tools I want to try out. That way if I forget about them and they get hacked or something, I don't have to worry about it.</p>
<p>As fun as it is, I also know that switching tools is a waste of time. The tools are nothing but a distraction in the end. I try to avoid switching tools as much as possible. I only switch tools when I'm sure that the new tool will improve my workflow. I also try to keep my toolset as small as possible.</p>
<h2>Learn new things.</h2>
<p>This year I learned how to use 11ty. In fact this website is built in 11ty. I also learned about Github Actions. I use to deploy small projects to my staging server.</p>
