# Welcome to my site

## What it is this site built with?
- [Eleventy.js](https://www.11ty.dev)
- [Nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks)
- A little PHP

## About CSS Structure
Style.css contains the main styles for the site or elements that are used in all pages. The rest of the styles are in the respective pages.
For example: there should only be one H1 on a site so why give it a classname? Just style it in the main stylesheet.

### Responsive.css
There's a separate responsive css file which is easier for tweaking the many breakpoints I've set. I've tried to keep the breakpoints to a minimum but I've found that it's easier to tweak the styles in a separate file.

## Responsive Breakpoints
- 320px
- 480px
- 768px
- 1024px
- `> 1280px`

### Styling feature
`.highlight` class is used for highlighting text. It's a css var `--highlight-color` which is a light green color.

### Content elements
#### Job Title in Portfolio items
For Portfolio items sometimes I'd like to add a job title and sometimes I don't. There's a conditional in the nunjucks file that checks if there's a job title and if there is it will display it.
